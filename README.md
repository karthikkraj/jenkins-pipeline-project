## 🔄 CI/CD Workflow – From Code to Deployment
1. **Developer commits changes** → Automatically triggers Jenkins pipeline.
2. **Build & Linting Phase** → Code is pulled from GitHub, compiled, and checked for quality.
3. **SonarQube Analysis** → The source code is sent to SonarQube for static code analysis to ensure reliability and maintainability.
4. **Testing Stage** → Automated tests validate functionality before proceeding.
5. **Dockerization** → The application is built into a Docker image for portability and consistency.
6. **Deployment** → The Dockerized application is deployed to the production environment.
7. **Real-Time Monitoring** → Continuous tracking of system performance and logs.

## 🛠 Setup Instructions
### Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (Latest LTS version)
- **Docker** (For containerization)
- **Jenkins** (For automation)
- **SonarQube** (For code analysis)
- **Supabase account** (For authentication services)

### Installation & Running Locally
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/karthikkraj/jenkins-pipeline-project.git
   cd jenkins-pipeline-project
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```sh
   cd frontend && npm install
   cd ../backend && npm install
   ```
3. **Run the Application:**
   ```sh
   cd backend && npm start
   cd ../frontend && npm run dev
   ```

### Running the CI/CD Pipeline
1. **Set up Jenkins:** Install required plugins for Node.js, Docker, and SonarQube.
2. **Configure the Jenkinsfile:** Update credentials and paths if necessary.
3. **Trigger a Build:** Jenkins pulls the latest code from GitHub and starts the pipeline.
4. **Run SonarQube Analysis:** The source code is analyzed for bugs, vulnerabilities, and maintainability.
5. **Build Docker Image:** The validated application is built into a Docker image.
6. **Deploy to Production:** The Docker image is pushed and deployed to the hosting environment.
7. **Monitor Deployment:** Check logs and SonarQube reports for performance insights.
